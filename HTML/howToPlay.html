    <h1>HOW TO PLAY DUCK DECKERS</h1>
<p style="font-size: xx-large">1. Make a room code for your opponent to join with <br>
2. The player who created the room goes first. <br>
3. Take turns placing ducks to attack the enemy. <br>
4. To play a duck, make sure you have enough Emeralds, then click the card in your hand and click a tile on your side<br>
5. To attack with a duck, click a duck in play and hit SPACE. Then click on your target<br>
6. You must defeat all the other ducks on the opponent's side in order to attack the player.<br>
7. At the start of your turn, you will gain Emeralds. Emeralds do not carry over, so spend them!<br>
8. Who ever drops their opponent's health to zero first wins!</p>
