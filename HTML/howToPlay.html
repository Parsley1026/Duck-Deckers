    <h1>HOW TO PLAY DUCK DECKERS</h1>
<p>In Duck Deckers, you play your duck cards to attack the opponent. When a duck is first played, it cannot attack. Ducks cost emeralds that refresh after each round. To attack with a duck, click it and press "A" on
your keyboard. then select your target. You can attack an enemy duck or the enemy themself. To win, get your enemy to zero health. Unfortunately due to time constraints, we are unable to indicate how much damage
a duck has taken, so just try to use your memory :3</p>
